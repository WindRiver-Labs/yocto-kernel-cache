Subject: [PATCH 0909/1852] mtd: spi-nor: Rename "n25q512a" to "mt25qu512a
 (n25q512a)"

commit 9607af6f857ff062b29562fc1fe36d22b16b9d27 upstream

n25q512a was rebranded to mt25qu512a after its spin off from STM.
mt25qu512a is different only in terms of operating frequency, the
JEDEC id is the same as in n25q512a.

Dual reads are supported (0x3b, 0x3c), set the SPI_NOR_DUAL_READ flag.
4-byte opcodes are supported, set the SPI_NOR_4B_OPCODES flag.

Tested Single I/O and QUAD I/O mode on LS1046FRWY.
