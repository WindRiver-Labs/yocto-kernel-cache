Subject: [PATCH 5/7] dm verity: skip verity work if I/O error when system is
 shutting down

[ Upstream commit 252bd1256396cebc6fc3526127fdb0b317601318 ]

If emergency system shutdown is called, like by thermal shutdown,
a dm device could be alive when the block device couldn't process
I/O requests anymore. In this state, the handling of I/O errors
by new dm I/O requests or by those already in-flight can lead to
a verity corruption state, which is a misjudgment.

So, skip verity work in response to I/O error when system is shutting
down.
