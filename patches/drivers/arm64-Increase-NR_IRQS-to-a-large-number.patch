Subject: [PATCH 318/767] arm64: Increase NR_IRQS to a large number

commit 98df58c8874349fe287a41e7ed667721eb7022cb from
git@git.assembla.com:cavium/WindRiver.linux.git

Platforms with multiple SR-IOV capable PCI devices will
need large number of MSIX vectors. Hence increase
NR_IRQS to 64K, so that enabling MSIX for a device doesn't
fail due to shortage of IRQs in the system.
