Subject: [PATCH 233/767] mmc: cavium: CMD19/21 type correction

commit cbeecc0d045020372935d4982b5aabfa4cf8dd4b from
git@git.assembla.com:cavium/WindRiver.linux.git

The Octeon host controller assumes the return-type and
bus-activity type of commands, so it can boot from eMMC
without software assistance, and support minimal operation
with minimal firmware.
As some details differ between eMMC and SD-card dialects,
and new commands are added as standards evolve, exceptions
to this assumed ctype/rtype table may be forced as commands
are issued, via MIO_EMM_CMD[CTYPE_XOR,RTYPE_XOR] fields.

The driver's knowledge of the hardware's assumption about
two tuning commands is incorrect:
- BUSTEST_W (CMD19) is an output command;
- MMC_SEND_TUNING_BLOCK_HS200 (CMD21) is an R1 read command.

Now these can be issued without error.
