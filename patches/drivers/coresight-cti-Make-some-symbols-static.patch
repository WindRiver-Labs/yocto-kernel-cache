Subject: [PATCH 1706/1921] coresight: cti: Make some symbols static

Fix the following sparse warning:

drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-cti.c:22:1: warning: symbol
'ect_net' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-cti.c:625:32: warning: symbol
'cti_ops_ect' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-cti.c:630:28: warning: symbol
'cti_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?
