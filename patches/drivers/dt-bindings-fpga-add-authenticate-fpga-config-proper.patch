Subject: [PATCH 112/120] dt-bindings: fpga: add authenticate-fpga-config
 property

commit ae2f65a3a25700d27958eb53e43d7852a5298728 from
https://github.com/altera-opensource/linux-socfpga.git

Add authenticate-fpga-config property for FPGA bitstream authentication,
which makes sure a signed bitstream has valid signatures.
