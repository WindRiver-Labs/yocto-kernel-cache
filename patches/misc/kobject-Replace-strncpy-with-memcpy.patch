Subject: [PATCH 3/5] kobject: Replace strncpy with memcpy

commit 77d2a24b6107bd9b3bf2403a65c1428a9da83dd0 upstream

gcc 8.1.0 complains:

lib/kobject.c:128:3: warning:
        'strncpy' output truncated before terminating nul copying as many
        bytes from a string as its length [-Wstringop-truncation]
lib/kobject.c: In function 'kobject_get_path':
lib/kobject.c:125:13: note: length computed here

Using strncpy() is indeed less than perfect since the length of data to
be copied has already been determined with strlen(). Replace strncpy()
with memcpy() to address the warning and optimize the code a little.
