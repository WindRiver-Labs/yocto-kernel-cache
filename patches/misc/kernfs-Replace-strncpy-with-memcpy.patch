Subject: [PATCH 2/5] kernfs: Replace strncpy with memcpy

commit 166126c1e54d927c2e8efa2702d420e0ce301fd9 upstream

gcc 8.1.0 complains:

fs/kernfs/symlink.c:91:3: warning:
        'strncpy' output truncated before terminating nul copying
        as many bytes from a string as its length
fs/kernfs/symlink.c: In function 'kernfs_iop_get_link':
fs/kernfs/symlink.c:88:14: note: length computed here

Using strncpy() is indeed less than perfect since the length of data to
be copied has already been determined with strlen(). Replace strncpy()
with memcpy() to address the warning and optimize the code a little.
