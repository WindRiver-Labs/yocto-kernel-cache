Subject: [PATCH 15/23] futex: Provide distinct return value when owner is
 exiting

commit ac31c7ff8624409ba3c4901df9237a616c187a5d upstream

attach_to_pi_owner() returns -EAGAIN for various cases:

 - Owner task is exiting
 - Futex value has changed

The caller drops the held locks (hash bucket, mmap_sem) and retries the
operation. In case of the owner task exiting this can result in a live
lock.

As a preparatory step for seperating those cases, provide a distinct return
value (EBUSY) for the owner exiting case.

No functional change.
