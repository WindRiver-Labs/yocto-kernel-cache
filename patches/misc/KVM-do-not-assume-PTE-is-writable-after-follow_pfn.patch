Subject: [PATCH 1/3] KVM: do not assume PTE is writable after follow_pfn

commit bd2fae8da794b55bf2ac02632da3a151b10e664c upstream.

In order to convert an HVA to a PFN, KVM usually tries to use
the get_user_pages family of functinso.  This however is not
possible for VM_IO vmas; in that case, KVM instead uses follow_pfn.

In doing this however KVM loses the information on whether the
PFN is writable.  That is usually not a problem because the main
use of VM_IO vmas with KVM is for BARs in PCI device assignment,
however it is a bug.  To fix it, use follow_pte and check pte_write
while under the protection of the PTE lock.  The information can
be used to fail hva_to_pfn_remapped or passed back to the
caller via *writable.

Usage of follow_pfn was introduced in commit add6a0cd1c5b ("KVM: MMU: try to fix
up page faults before giving up", 2016-07-05); however, even older version
have the same issue, all the way back to commit 2e2e3738af33 ("KVM:
Handle vma regions with no backing page", 2008-07-20), as they also did
not check whether the PFN was writable.
