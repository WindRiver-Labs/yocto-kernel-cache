Subject: [PATCH 3/3] ext4: make variable "count" signed

commit bc75a6eb856cb1507fa907bf6c1eda91b3fef52f upstream.

Since dx_make_map() may return -EFSCORRUPTED now, so change "count" to
be a signed integer so we can correctly check for an error code returned
by dx_make_map().

Fixes: 46c116b920eb ("ext4: verify dir block before splitting it")
