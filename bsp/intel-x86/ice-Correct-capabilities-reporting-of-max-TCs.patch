Subject: [PATCH 405/421] ice: Correct capabilities reporting of max TCs

commit 9164f761c99493a947dcbf3889a157943b46e738 upstream.

Firmware always returns 8 as the max number of supported TCs. However on
devices with more than 4 ports, the maximum number of TCs per port is
limited to 4. Check and, if necessary, correct the reporting of
capabilities for devices with more than 4 ports.
