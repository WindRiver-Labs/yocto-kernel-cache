Subject: [PATCH 391/421] ice: avoid setting features during reset

commit 5f8cc355c4134767aa586920458cc21e01295715 upstream.

Certain subsystems behave very badly when called during reset (core
dump). This patch returns -EBUSY when reconfiguring some subsystems
during reset. With this patch some ethtool functions will not core
dump during reset.
