Subject: [PATCH 026/421] ice: Update comment for ice_fltr_mgmt_list_entry

commit 8bc8d188cde0eeaacad3afd25b8c95ec74d1d217 upstream.

Previously the comment stated that VSI lists should be used when a
second VSI becomes a subscriber to the "VLAN address". VSI lists
are always used for VLAN membership, so replace "VLAN address" with
"MAC address". Also note that VLAN(s) always use VSI list rules.
