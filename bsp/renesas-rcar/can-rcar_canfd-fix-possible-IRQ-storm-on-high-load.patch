Subject: [PATCH 854/909] can: rcar_canfd: fix possible IRQ storm on high load

commit 0c0b56e36d1b3479f5e3f6c2b8bf52b89caa3b78 from
https://github.com/CogentEmbedded/meta-rcar.git

We have observed rcar_canfd driver entering IRQ storm under high load,
with following scenario:
- rcar_canfd_global_interrupt() in entered due to Rx available,
- napi_schedule_prep() is called, and sets NAPIF_STATE_SCHED in state
- Rx fifo interrupts are masked,
- rcar_canfd_global_interrupt() is entered again, this time due to
  error interrupt (e.g. due to overflow),
- since scheduled napi poller has not yet executed, condition for calling
  napi_schedule_prep() from rcar_canfd_global_interrupt() remains true,
  thus napi_schedule_prep() gets called and sets NAPIF_STATE_MISSED flag
  in state,
- later, napi poller function rcar_canfd_rx_poll() gets executed, and
  calls napi_complete_done(),
- due to NAPIF_STATE_MISSED flag in state, this call does not clear
  NAPIF_STATE_SCHED flag from state,
- on return from napi_complete_done(), rcar_canfd_rx_poll() unmasks Rx
  interrutps,
- Rx interrupt happens, rcar_canfd_global_interrupt() gets called
  and calls napi_schedule_prep(),
- since NAPIF_STATE_SCHED is set in state at this time, this call
  returns false,
- due to that false return, rcar_canfd_global_interrupt() returns
  without masking Rx interrupt
- and this results into IRQ storm: unmasked Rx interrupt happens again
  and again is misprocessed in the same way.

This patch fixes that scenario by unmasking Rx interrupts only when
napi_complete_done() returns true, which means it has cleared
NAPIF_STATE_SCHED in state.
