Subject: [PATCH 052/138] mmc: cavium: fix shutdown deadlock with active
 sd-card

commit f9f49c11bcee90bd5b6ebcff948a91c727c2e2c7 from
git@git.assembla.com:cavium/WindRiver.linux.git

Shutdown of mmc with an actively polling mmc_rescan can deadlock
on the mmc_serializer semaphore, as the active 1Hz polling (done
when the hardware has no GPIO card-present line) is not disabled
until the card is powered off. Both the polling and power-off
request require the semaphore, but as the shutdown method is not
brokered by the mmc/core infrastructure, it exposes a deadlock
no other interaction would trigger.

The situation can be reliably provoked when reboot is requested
while mmc-test module is active on a removable SD-card without a
private GPIO card-present line, but has also been seen in other
circumstances where the card's user is non-interruptible, like
mounted filesystems.

This semaphore prevents the mmc host hardware (controller and bus
signals) being used by multiple connected card slots concurrently.
On some Octeon platforms the bus signals are also shared with other
devices, hence the pluggable acquire/release functions.

Semaphore is held while a card slot has active state in the hardware,
and released when that state (timing, power, bus width, rca, etc) is
saved in software at end of transaction.

Device's shutdown method could be used to dismantle the polling,
(by host->caps &= ~MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL), but device-specific
shutdown/suspend methods are called too late to effect this teardown
before the general mmc infrastructure has caused the deadlock.

But there's one state transition which does not affect the shared
resources mmc_serializer is protecting: the set_ios(MMC_POWER_OFF)
transition which mmc_shutdown is trying to effect, which is initiated
before any device-specific entry points.

Exempting this _POWER_OFF from the acquire/release dance breaks the
deadlock.
Apart from tracking the state in host->powered, the only other change
needed is a check for !host->powered in the switch_val_changed()
test, because when set_ios() is called with _POWER_OFF, the other
elements of the state are no longer propagated to hardware.
