Subject: [PATCH 652/741] dt-bindings: PCI: designware: Remove the num-lanes
 from Required properties

commit 70a6f649e7c6bcb2e44b565ec3b0a57b69bdf4f2 from
http://source.codeaurora.org/external/qoriq/qoriq-components/linux

The num-lanes is not a mandatory property, e.g. on FSL
Layerscape SoCs, the PCIe link training is completed
automatically base on the selected SerDes protocol, it
doesn't need the num-lanes to set-up the link width.

It is previously in both Required and Optional properties,
let's remove it from the Required properties.
