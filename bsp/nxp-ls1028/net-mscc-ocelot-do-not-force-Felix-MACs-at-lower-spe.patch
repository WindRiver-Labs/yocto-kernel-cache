Subject: [PATCH 692/741] net: mscc: ocelot: do not force Felix MACs at lower
 speeds than gigabit

commit 82da1dc23d082e6a693fcaacf5a9427b1335b429 from
http://source.codeaurora.org/external/qoriq/qoriq-components/linux

In the LS1028A, the VSC9959 switch was integrated with an NXP PCS which
performs SGMII AN and rate adaptation autonomously. The MAC does not
need to know about this, and forcing the MAC speed to something else,
when connected to a 10/100 link partner, actually breaks the GMII
internal link between the MAC and the PCS.

This should be described better with PHYLINK, by configuring 'managed =
"in-band-status";' in the device tree, so that the PHY library core will
avoid even attempting to force the link speed. This is not possible with
PHYLIB. For now, this workaround will have to do.
