Subject: [PATCH 0140/1345] arm64: neta: a3700: add SFP support both in
 1G/2.5G modes

commit  2f18b2f7742da5288815847ef7788f738d722cb6 from
https://github.com/MarvellEmbeddedProcessors/linux-marvell.git

- Add a new dts for SFP 1G/2.5G board configuration, keep neta0 in
  RGMII mode and set neta1 to SFP over SGMII1 in the fixed-link mode;
- Now for the fixed-link mode, speed setting and duplex setting are
  supported while pause setting for flow control is not supported yet.
